# MachineBettingLearning
A machine learning model that predicts NBA game outcomes using historical data, team performance, player stats, and an inputted over/under line to provide betting insights.
This project is a machine learning-based system specifically designed to predict NBA game outcomes by analyzing historical game data, team performance, player statistics, and an inputted over/under line. It leverages data science techniques such as regression models, classification algorithms, and statistical analysis to generate actionable betting predictions. The model continuously improves by learning from past NBA data, aiming to provide more accurate and reliable betting insights over time.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing & Feature Extraction: Efficiently processes raw NBA data, extracting key features such as player stats, team performance, and external factors relevant to game outcomes.
Inputted Over/Under Line: Incorporates user-defined over/under lines into the prediction models for enhanced betting insights.
Machine Learning Models: Trains models using multiple algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks to provide well-rounded predictions.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions.
Continuous Learning: The model is updated regularly with fresh NBA data, enabling it to adapt and improve prediction accuracy with each game.
How It Works:
Data Input: The system gathers historical NBA game data, including scores, player statistics, and team performance metrics.
Feature Engineering: Key features such as player efficiency, team trends, and external conditions are extracted from the data.
Model Training: The machine learning model is trained using these features and past outcomes, incorporating regression and classification algorithms.
Prediction: Users input an over/under line for the game, and the system generates a prediction for the outcome, providing insights on whether the score will exceed or fall short of the line.
Usage:
Input historical game data or use pre-loaded datasets.
Define an over/under line for the game you wish to analyze.
Run the model to receive predictions and performance evaluations.
This system is ideal for users looking to analyze NBA games from a statistical perspective and gain insights for more informed betting decisions.
